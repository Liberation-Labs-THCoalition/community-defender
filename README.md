# Sereno

*Las once y sereno — eleven o'clock and all is clear.*

Security for the rest of us. A neighbor with a lantern, not a corporate security product.

Named after the [serenos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sereno_(nightwatchman)) — community night watchmen of Spain and Latin America who walked the streets, checked locks, and called out the hour so everyone could sleep.

## What It Does

Sereno watches your machine for security threats and tells you what it finds in language you understand. No cloud. No accounts. No telemetry. Runs on a Raspberry Pi.

- **Scans** for compromised packages, malware persistence, exposed credentials, suspicious processes
- **Monitors** file integrity against a known-good baseline
- **Advises** on hardening — what to fix and how, in plain language
- **Alerts** through channels you actually check (Discord, terminal, log files)
- **Thinks** proactively about what to check and when (BDI reasoning engine)

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Liberation-Labs-THCoalition/community-defender.git
cd community-defender

# Full assessment — scan, harden, baseline, everything
python3 -m sentinel all

# Just the security scan
python3 -m sentinel scan

# Hardening recommendations
python3 -m sentinel harden

# Set up file integrity baseline
python3 -m sentinel baseline create

# Check for changes since baseline
python3 -m sentinel baseline check
```

No dependencies beyond Python 3.8+. No pip install. Clone and run.

## What It Checks

| Check | What it looks for |
|-------|-------------------|
| **Supply chain** | npm/pip packages on known-compromised lists |
| **Persistence** | Malware hooks in Claude Code, VS Code, LaunchAgents, systemd, .pth files |
| **Processes** | Cryptominers, reverse shells, token monitors |
| **Network** | Unexpected listening ports |
| **Credentials** | Exposed tokens in .npmrc, API keys in .env files |
| **Git repos** | Exfiltration branches (Shai-Hulud indicators) |
| **File integrity** | Changes to critical files since last baseline |

## Alerts

```bash
# Print to terminal (default)
python3 -m sentinel scan

# Send to Discord
python3 -m sentinel scan --discord https://discord.com/api/webhooks/YOUR/WEBHOOK

# Log to file
python3 -m sentinel scan --log /var/log/sereno.log

# Cron mode — only output if something's wrong
python3 -m sentinel scan --cron
```

## Proactive Guardian

Sereno includes a BDI (Beliefs-Desires-Intentions) engine that decides what to check and when. Set it on a cron and it watches while you sleep.

```bash
# See what the guardian believes, desires, and intends
python3 -m sentinel.guardian --status

# Run all due checks
python3 -m sentinel.guardian

# Force a full sweep now
python3 -m sentinel.guardian --force all

# Set up the cron (every 4 hours)
crontab -e
# Add: 0 */4 * * * cd /path/to/community-defender && PYTHONPATH=. python3 -m sentinel.guardian >> ~/.sereno/guardian.log 2>&1
```

The guardian maintains beliefs about your system state, desires for security, and intentions that fire skill chains automatically. It learns what's normal and alerts when something changes.

## Threat Feeds

Known-bad packages are tracked in `feeds/`. Currently seeded with [Shai-Hulud](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-45321) indicators (the npm/PyPI supply chain worm of May 2026). Update by pulling the repo:

```bash
git pull  # that's it
```

No API keys. No accounts. No subscription.

## Who This Is For

- **Community organizers** running shared infrastructure
- **People hosting local AI** for their friends and communities
- **Family members** who love technology but don't know what opsec means
- **Mutual aid networks** coordinating on platforms they haven't audited
- **Antifascist organizations** protecting vulnerable community members
- **Anyone** who deserves security but can't afford Glasswing

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- That's it

Optional: `numpy` for the geometry probe features. Not required for scanning.

## Born From a Real Incident

On May 11, 2026, the [Mini Shai-Hulud worm](https://www.wiz.io/blog/mini-shai-hulud-strikes-again-tanstack-more-npm-packages-compromised) compromised 172 npm and PyPI packages with valid SLSA Build Level 3 signatures. We swept four machines clean by hand in twenty minutes. Then we built Sereno so everyone can do the same.

## Contributing

Threat feed updates, new checks, new alert transports, and plain-language improvements are all welcome. See the feeds directory for the format.

If you find a vulnerability in Sereno itself, please report it privately.
